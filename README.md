PSEUDOCODE

I will keep with the same retro-theme that I have been using throughout the course.

Make a master button that controls the start and restart of the game.
Will most likely need a few empty divs to populate.
As a stretch goal, I will try to add difficulty levels based on time countdown (i.e. easy = 60 seconds, hard = 20 seconds)

Each question and answers should be created as a JSON object
These should be able to be looped through for each question

The user choice should be logged, and an immediate result should be given.

The results page should display the total questions answered correctly and incorrectly.

For fun I will add in a progress bar to either supplement the countdown clock or to the use it for more of the intended purpose of giving the user an indication on how many questions remain.

If time permits, fiddle with the timer to be specific to each page/question. This kind of customization could additionally be factored into user options at the beginning. Change countdown variables to "SPEED", i.e. easy=leisure, normal=chill, hard=uncomfortable. Then create "MODE" page-by-page and apply-to-all. "Apply-to-all" would be really hard on "uncomfortable" mode.
